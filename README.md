# SFP to USB Adapter
**SFP** stands for Small Form Factor Pluggable modules.The aim of this project is to develop **SFP to USB** adapter, So that USB signal can be extended over long distace

Although there are lot USB Fiber hubs in market,they are quite expensive.Using   
**Gigabit SFP** modules reduces cost significantly and it is also nice way to learn how USB and Fiber Optics Work ðŸ˜Ž

This project is done as of my **Master's Course** and **REPORT** is available in repo.

***
Project development is as follows:

1. Finding suitable **SFP modules/Transcievers**


2. Finding suitable **IC or Micocontroller**


3. Designing **PCB**

4. Assembly of Components on **PCB**
